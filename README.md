# Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System using ML

This project implements a **Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques, developed as part of the **AICTE Edunet-Shell Skills4Future** program focused on **Green Skills & AI**. The system aims to provide recommendations for crop cultivation and fertilizer usage based on different environmental factors, such as soil quality, temperature, and moisture levels.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that:
1. **Recommends suitable crops** based on soil and climate conditions.
2. **Suggests fertilizers** to optimize crop growth based on soil nutrient levels.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and categorical data.
- Machine learning models for crop and fertilizer prediction.
- Data visualization to understand correlations and distributions.
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and precision.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoorulHasan4129/Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System.git
